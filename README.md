Grok Conversation Cleaner 🚀
A lightweight, browser-agnostic JavaScript utility designed specifically to automate the "Force Delete" process on the Grok "Deleted Conversations" page. This script saves you from manual clicking by batch-processing all visible deletion buttons in seconds.

⚡ Quick Start
To keep your workspace clean and ensure you are using the most up-to-date logic, we have centralized the automation code.

🛠 How to Use
Navigate: Go to your Grok Deleted Conversations page.

Access the Script: Open the script.js file in this repository and copy the entire code block.

Open Browser Console: * Windows/Linux: Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + J

macOS: Press Cmd + Option + J

Paste & Run: Paste the copied code into the Console tab and hit Enter.

🛡 Features
Batch Automation: Instantly scans the page and identifies every "Force Delete" button.

Staggered Execution: Built-in delays between clicks to prevent browser lag and ensure the server accepts every request.

Zero Dependencies: Pure JavaScript that runs natively in any modern browser without extensions.

⚠️ Warning
This action is permanent. "Force Delete" is a destructive operation that bypasses the recovery phase. Once this script executes, your selected conversations are gone forever. Double-check that you are on the correct page before running the script.
