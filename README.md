# Force Delete Automator 🚀

A simple, browser-agnostic JavaScript snippet to automate clicking "Force Delete" buttons on web pages. Perfect for clearing out long lists of deleted conversations or logs that lack a "Select All" feature.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Navigate to the page containing the items you wish to delete.
2. Open the **Browser Console**:
   - Windows/Linux: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + J`
   - macOS: `Cmd + Option + J`
3. Copy the code from `script.js` in this repository.
4. Paste it into the console and press **Enter**.

## ⚠️ Warning
This script clicks buttons automatically. Since "Force Delete" is usually permanent, please ensure you are on the correct page and actually want to delete all visible items before running the script.
